## Adding or fixing Javascript syntax

The process of adding or fixing Javascript parsing/instrumenting issues is quite straightforward. Qoverage iterates through the JS AST generated by `qmldom`. To generate correct instrumentation, it usually only needs to know for each AST node:

* How to get the start offset (in characters from file start)? This is the point just before the statement/expression starts.
* Likewise for the end offset. Note that for many nodes, the end is actually determined by a child node (such as "a && b", which is a BinaryExpression but to find its end you need to find the end of the "b" node).
* Whether, if found in a statement list, this node would potentially end linear code execution. Examples: if, while, for, break, continue, yield, ...
* Whether the node has any children that should also be visited. By default, if the start and end are known, children are skipped. Nodes with relevant children are e.g.: if/else, for, while, try, ...

The ways to tell the above properties for each node are defined in the [dom.py](qoverage/dom.py) file. All node types given by `qmldom` are already listed there, some are just commented out.

## Adding/changing Javascript analysis and testing

With new/changed functionality, you should also add or change (a) testcase(s). See [test/README.md](test/README.md).
